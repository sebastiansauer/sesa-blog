      <description>Load packages library(tidyverse) library(MASS) Motivation It is well-known that the notorious (Pearson’s) correlation cannot exceed an absolute value greater than 1, that is
\[ -1 \le r \le +1 \]
or
\[ |r| \le 1 \]
However, proofing this fact is less straightforward. A classical way of proofing the above inequality is by using the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality. From a teacher’s perspective, the CS inequality may not be ideal, because the students may lack some knowledge necessary for appreciating this proof.</description>

      <description>Load packages library(tidyverse) Motivation Z-scores (z-values) are a useful and widely employed tool to gauge and compare measurements. For instance, z-scores help to compare the relative position of some measurements with respect to their distributions. In this post, we will prove some basic (algebraic) properties of z-values. There’s nothing new to that, it’s just I’d like to have it neat and concise somewhere to quickly find it. I’ll add some explanation for the ease of reception.</description>

      <description> How to include external images to a hugo post?
Suppose we have a file img1.png in project1, ie., project1/img1.png. Do this:
Copy your folder with images to static/. Use this path in your blogdown post: /project/img1.png. Mind the leading slash! Example time This code (on my machine) ![](/images/textmining/tidytext-crop.png){ width=&amp;quot;20%&amp;quot; }
renders this:
Note the nice width option.
Knitr way The knitr way works similarly:
knitr::include_graphics(&amp;quot;/images/textmining/tidytext-crop.png&amp;quot;) </description>
