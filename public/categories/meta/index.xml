It is now here! This is the new home of my blog. In (the unlikely) case you are asking yourself “Why did you move your blog?”, here is the answer.&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I was using Jekyll at Github pages which is great as long as you do not have a lot of R in your posts. But I did have a lot of R in my posts. The problem is that there is no builtin support for rendering R codes to the markdown file. That means that I ended up fixing images links all day long (well, every littel now and then).&lt;/p&gt;</description>
