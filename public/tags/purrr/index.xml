List columns are a powerful feature of the tidyverse that allow you to store multiple objects in a single column of a data frame.</description>

      <description>Load packages library(tidyverse) Problem statement Assume you have to call a function multiple times, but each with (possibly) different argument. Given enough repitioons, you will not want to repeat yourself.
In other words, we would like to loop over function arguments, each round in the loop giving the respective argumentâ€™value(s) to the function.
One example would be to generate many random values but each with different mean and/or sd:</description>

      <description>Load packages library(tidyverse) Rowwwise operations are a quite frequent operations in data analysis. The R language environment is particularly strong in column wise operations. This is due to technical reasons, as data frames are internally built as column-by-column structures, hence column wise operations are simple, rowwise more difficult.
This post looks at some rather general way to comput rowwise statistics. Of course, numerous ways exist and there are quite a few tutorials around, notably by Jenny Bryant, and by Emil Hvitfeldt to name a few.</description>

      <description>Load packages library(tidyverse) Basic testing for equality Testing for equality in a kind of very basic function in computer (and data) science. There is a straightforward function in R to test for equality:
identical(1, 1) #&amp;gt; [1] TRUE identical(&amp;quot;A&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;A&amp;quot;) #&amp;gt; [1] TRUE identical(1, 2) #&amp;gt; [1] FALSE identical(1, NA) #&amp;gt; [1] FALSE However this get more complicated if we want to compare more than two elements. One way to achieve this is to compute the number of the different items.</description>

      <title>Summary for multiple variables using purrr</title>

      <description>A frequent task in data analysis is to get a summary of a bunch of variables. Often, graphical summaries (diagrams) are wanted. However, at times numerical summaries are in order. How to get that in R? That&amp;rsquo;s the question of the present post.
Of course, there are several ways. One way, using purrr, is the following. I liked it quite a bit that&amp;rsquo;s why I am showing it here.
First, let&amp;rsquo;s load some data and some packages we will make use of.</description>
