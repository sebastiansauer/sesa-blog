      <description>A DOI is useful feature to any electronic document. What the ID number in your passport is to you is the DOI to a document. It simply helps to make sure you address the &amp;ldquo;object&amp;rdquo; you want to address.
Similarly, there may exists several &amp;ldquo;Joachims Zwiwwelkoecks&amp;rdquo; in this world (well, it may or may not be the case). However, if any of this person gets his (or her) unique ID (could by a simple number), then we would in principle always be certain that we address the right person.</description>
