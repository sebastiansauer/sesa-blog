      <description>&lt;p&gt;tl;dr: great book. Read.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The &amp;ldquo;Seven Sins&amp;rdquo; is concerned about the validity of psychological research. Can we at all, or to what degree, be certain about the conclusions reached in psychological research? More recently, replications efforts have cast doubt on our confidence in psychological research (1). In a similar vein, a recent papers states that in many research areas, researchers mostly report &amp;ldquo;successes&amp;rdquo; in the sense of that they report that their studies confirm their hypotheses - with Psychology leading in the proportion of supported hypotheses (2). To good to be true? In the light of all this unbehagen, Chambers&amp;rsquo; book addresses some of the (possible) roots of the problem of (un)reliability of psychological science. Precisely, Chambers mentions seven &amp;ldquo;sins&amp;rdquo; that the psychological research community appears to be guilty of: confirmation bias, data tuning (&amp;ldquo;hidden flexibility&amp;rdquo;), disregard of direct replications (and related problems), failure to share data (&amp;ldquo;data hoarding&amp;rdquo;), fraud, lack of open access publishing, and fixation on impact factors.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;One way to dig into some topic such as data analysis is just-doing, trial and error. Another way is reading blogs; a fruitful avenue in my experience. However, the classical way of reading some good book is all but outdated.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Here are some recommendations of books I found helpful as a starter (books in English and &lt;em&gt;German&lt;/em&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;h2 id=&#34;r-for-data-science&#34;&gt;R for Data Science&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Grolemund, G., &amp;amp; Wickham, H. (2016). R for Data Science. Oâ€™Reilly Media, Incorporated.
