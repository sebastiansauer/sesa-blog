Note that you need to be online to render the slides (due to heavy use of JS).&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The Rmd source code (master file) can be found &lt;a href=&#34;https://data-se.netlify.com/slides/ws-md-git-2019/ws-md-git-2019.Rmd&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The PDF version of the slides can be found &lt;a href=&#34;https://data-se.netlify.com/slides/ws-md-git-2019/ws-md-git-2019.pdf&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>How to document a conference talk in citation manager software</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;There are several popular citation manager software packages around. I used to work with Mendeley in class, but I stopped using it since it was acquired by El$sevier. Luckily there are good alternatives around, particularly Zotero. Zotero features a Word (MS Word, Libre Word) plugin, which is a must have for many of us. The more technically inclined folks will use Bibtex. Good news is that Zotero syncs it Library to Bibtex. Best of both worlds with Zotero – I recommend using Zotero.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>A clean sessionInfo page</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Writing a technical or academic report, or even a presentation, it is sensible to render the (R) code in such a writing reproducible. Same thing applies when asking for help at StackOverflow: you’ll be asked for a &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/tidyverse/reprex&#34;&gt;reprex&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;One aspect for rendering a report reproducible is to include details on the version of packages needed. The well-known command &lt;code&gt;sessionInf()&lt;/code&gt; provides the building blocks for that. However, the output of that function can feel verbose, and it consumes a lot of space.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>This blog now has a DOI</title>
      <link>https://data-se.netlify.app/2017/05/04/doi_added/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;A &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.doi.org&#34;&gt;DOI&lt;/a&gt; is useful feature to any electronic document. What the ID number in your passport is to you is the DOI to a document. It simply helps to make sure you address the &amp;ldquo;object&amp;rdquo; you want to address.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Similarly, there may exists several &amp;ldquo;Joachims Zwiwwelkoecks&amp;rdquo; in this world (well, it may or may not be the case). However, if any of this person gets his (or her) &lt;em&gt;unique&lt;/em&gt; ID (could by a simple number), then we would in principle always be certain that we address the right person.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Tools for Academic Writing - Comparison</title>
      <link>https://data-se.netlify.app/2017/04/26/writing_tools/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Many tools exist for academic writing including the notorious W.O.R.D.; but many more are out there. Let&amp;rsquo;s have a look at those tools, and discuss what&amp;rsquo;s important (what we expect the tool to deliver, eg., beautiful typesetting).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;h1 id=&#34;typical-tools-for-academic-writing&#34;&gt;Typical tools for academic writing&lt;/h1&gt;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;MS Word&lt;/em&gt;: A &amp;ldquo;classical&amp;rdquo; choice, relied upon by myriads of white collar workers&amp;hellip; I myself have used it extensively for academic writing; the main advantage being its simplicity, that is, well, everybody knows it, and knows more or less how to handle it. It&amp;rsquo;s widespread use is of course an advantage.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
