      <description>1 Load packages 2 Motivation 3 First: Quoted (string) parameter 4 Second: Unquoted parameter 5 Check 6 Bonus 1 Load packages library(tidyverse) # data wrangling 2 Motivation If a project reaches some level of complexity, sooner or later, more systematical meausures of coding need to be employed.
Using the tidyverse ecosystem, programming - instead of interactive use - may be something different or unusual and it may take some time to wrap your head around it.</description>

      <description>The tidyeval framework is a rather new, and in parts complementary, framework to dealing with non-standarde evaluation (NSE) in R. In short, NSE is about capturing some R-code, witholding execution, maybe editing the code, and finally execuing it later and/or somewhere else.
This post borrows heavily by Edwin Thon&amp;rsquo;s great post, and this post by the same author.
In addtion, most of the knowledge is derived from Hadley Wickham&amp;rsquo;s book Advanced R.</description>

      <description>More on programming with dplyr: converting quosures to strings In this post, we have programmed a simple function using dplyr&amp;rsquo;s programming capabilities based on tidyeval; for more intro to programming with dplyr, see here.
In this post, we&amp;rsquo;ll go one step further and programm a function where a quosure will be turned to a string. Why this? Because quite a number of functions out there except strings as input parameters.</description>

      <description>Recently, since dplyr &amp;lt;= 0.6.0 a new way of dealing with NSE was introduced, called tidyeval. As with every topic that begs our attention, the question &amp;ldquo;why bother&amp;rdquo; is in place. Theone answer is &amp;ldquo;you&amp;rsquo;ll need this stuff if you want to lock dplyr verbs inside a function&amp;rdquo;. Once you like dplyr and friends, a natural second step is to use the ideas not only for interactive use, but for more &amp;ldquo;programming&amp;rdquo; type, ie.</description>
