      <description>&lt;p&gt;This post presents a compilation of links to psychology papers; I have chosen papers I find intriguing particularly for working in class. All papers are open access (or a from open access repositories) which renders classroom work easier. The papers are collected from a broad range of topics but mostly with focus on general interest. The perspective is an applied one; I have not tried to select based on methodological rigor.  The collection is structured along the well-known classification of psychological work: social, personality, cognitive. I have added &amp;lsquo;social media/ psychoinformatics&amp;rsquo; as this reflects a topic I am quite interested in.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
