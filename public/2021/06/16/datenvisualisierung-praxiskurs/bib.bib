But with the increasing power of visualization software today, scientists, engineers, and business analysts often have to navigate a bewildering array of visualization choices and options. This practical book takes you through many commonly encountered visualization problems, and it provides guidelines on how to turn large datasets into clear and compelling figures. What visualization type is best for the story you want to tell? How do you make informative figures that are visually pleasing? Author Claus O. Wilke teaches you the elements most critical to successful data visualization."--Provided by publisher},

	isbn = {978-0-387-24544-7},

	series = {Statistics and Computing},
	abstract = {This book was written for statisticians, computer scientists, geographers, researchers, and others interested in visualizing data. It presents a unique foundation for producing almost every quantitative graphic found in scientific journals, newspapers, statistical packages, and data visualization systems. While the tangible results of this work have been several visualization software libraries, this book focuses on the deep structures involved in producing quantitative graphics from data. What are the rules that underlie the production of pie charts, bar charts, scatterplots, function plots, maps, mosaics, and radar charts? Those less interested in the theoretical and mathematical foundations can still get a sense of the richness and structure of the system by examining the numerous and often unique color graphics it can produce. The second edition is almost twice the size of the original, with six new chapters and substantial revision. Much of the added material makes this book suitable for survey courses in visualization and statistical graphics. From reviews of the first edition: "Destined to become a landmark in statistical graphics, this book provides a formal description of graphics, particularly static graphics, playing much the same role for graphics as probability theory played for statistics." Journal of the American Statistical Association "Wilkinsonâ€™s careful scholarship shows around every corner. This is a tour de force of the highest order." Psychometrika "All geography and map libraries should add this book to their collections; the serious scholar of quantitative data graphics will place this book on the same shelf with those by Edward Tufte, and volumes by Cleveland, Bertin, Monmonier, {MacEachren}, among others, and continue the unending task of proselytizing for the best in statistical data presentation by example and through scholarship like that of Leland Wilkinson." Cartographic Perspectives "In summary, this is certainly a remarkable book and a new ambitious step for the development and application of statistical graphics." Computational Statistics and Data Analysis About the author: Leland Wilkinson is Senior {VP}, {SPSS} Inc. and Adjunct Professor of Statistics at Northwestern University. He is also affiliated with the Computer Science department at The University of Illinois at Chicago. He wrote the {SYSTAT} statistical package and founded {SYSTAT} Inc. in 1984. Wilkinson joined {SPSS} in a 1994 acquisition and now works on research and development of visual analytics and statistics. He is a Fellow of the {ASA}. In addition to journal articles and the original {SYSTAT} computer program and manuals, Wilkinson is the author (with Grant Blank and Chris Gruber) of Desktop Data Analysis with {SYSTAT}.},
