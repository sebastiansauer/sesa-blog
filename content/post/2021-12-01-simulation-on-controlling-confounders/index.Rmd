# Confounder


A confounder is on of the few (maybe three) "atoms" of causality, following the framework of Judea Parl and others.

A confounder can be depicted like this:



```{r }
confounder_triangle(x = "chocolate",
                          y = "nobel price",
                          z = "development") %>% 
  ggdag_dconnected(text = FALSE, use_labels = "label") +
  theme_dag()
```



[Following a study](http://www.nejm.org/doi/abs/10.1056/NEJMon1211064) that reported a strong correlation between chocolate consumption and Nobel prices.



```{r out.width="50%"}
knitr::include_graphics("https://i0.wp.com/knowingneurons.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/correlation_550.png?w=550&ssl=1")
```


# Simulating a confounder structure


Now let's simulate a simple confounder structure.



```{r echo = FALSE}
d <- "https://vincentarelbundock.github.io/Rdatasets/csv/mosaicData/SaratogaHouses.csv"
```


Here's some code that will help us:


```{r}
source("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sebastiansauer/QM2-Folien/41bc43754169f64abd6ad98f8d52b5c0e23eda80/R-Code/controlling-confounder.R")
```

Let's have a look at the code:

```{r}
x <- read_file("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sebastiansauer/QM2-Folien/41bc43754169f64abd6ad98f8d52b5c0e23eda80/R-Code/controlling-confounder.R")
```

```{r}
cat(x)
```


# Here are the plots:


```{r}
p_konf1

p_konf2
```
