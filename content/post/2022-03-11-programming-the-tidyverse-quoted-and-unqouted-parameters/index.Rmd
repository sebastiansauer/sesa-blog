# Motivation


If a project reaches some level of complexity, sooner or later, more systematical meausures of coding need to be employed.

Using the tidyverse ecosystem, programming - instead of interactive use - 
may be something different or unusual and it may take some time to wrap your head around it.

In this post, I'll show how to deal with a standard situation (using tidyvserse' nonstandard evaluation).
More precisely, there are two (complementary) situations we'll address:

1. How to work with a *nonquoted* (bare, no quotation marks) parameter in a function call, e.g., `draw_cool_diagram(mtcars, hp)`.

2. 1. How to work with a *nquoted* (with quotation marks) parameter in a function call, e.g., `draw_cool_diagram(mtcars, "hp")`.



# First: Quoted (string) parameter


For the ease of comprehension, 
let's make a very simple function:
A function that pulls a column out of tibble,
returning a vector of the values.

The point is that we use a string as parameter value in the function
that uses tidyverse commands internally.


```{r}
pull_string <- function(data, var){
  
  var_symbol <- as.name(var)
  
  out <- 
  data %>% 
    pull({{var_symbol}})
  
  return(out)
}
```

Ok, here's the function call, note the *quoated* parameter `"hp"`:

```{r}
out1 <- pull_string(mtcars, "hp")
out1
```



The "curly curly" `{{` operator provides the candy here. 
It explains to the tidyverse function that `var_symbol` needs to evaluated in the environment of the data frame.

Note that we first translated `var` from a string to a symbol, using `as.name()`:


```{r}
as.name("hp")
```

Next to `as.name()`the curly-curly operator can be made use of.


# Second: Unquoted parameter

Ok, next, the *unquoted* parameter in our function.

```{r}
pull_unquoted <- function(data, var) {
  
  out <-
    data %>% 
    pull({{var}})
  
  return(out)
    
}

out2 <- pull_unquoted(mtcars, hp)
out2
```

Even more simple than method 1. Here, 
we don't need to translate `var` to a symbol,
because we already got in unquoted, ie., as a "symbol".


# Check

Did it work out?


```{r}
identical(out1, out2)
```

Seems so!


# Reproducibility

```{r reproducibility, echo = FALSE}
## Reproducibility info
options(width = 120)
devtools::session_info()

```
