```{r knitr-setup, echo = FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(
  comment = "#>",
  collapse = TRUE,
  message = FALSE,
  warning = FALSE,
  cache = TRUE,
  out.width = "100%",
  fig.align = 'center',
  fig.width = 6,
  fig.asp = 0.618,  # 1 / phi
  fig.show = "hold",
  size = "tiny"
)
```



# Motivation

Knime and R have their specific strengths (and weaknesses). Let's compare the R workflow in [this post](https://data-se.netlify.app/2020/12/05/execution-time-for-largish-data/#typical-data-wrangling) with this [knime workflow](https://github.com/sebastiansauer/sesa-blog/blob/main/static/div/largish-data-wrangling.knwf).



```{r echo = FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sebastiansauer/sesa-blog/main/static/images/knwf-largish1.png")
```


# Comparison

What you think? As an old-fart R user I feel pressed to admit that Knime appears to be a useful and handy tool.


# Caveat

Repeating the workflow for a larger data set, [NYC yellow cabs 2019-01]( https://s3.amazonaws.com/nyc-tlc/trip+data/yellow_tripdata_2020-01.csv), it seems that my Knime got stuck (on a 2020 MacBook Pro, 16 GB machine).
