# Motivation

Knime and R have their specific strengths (and weaknesses). Let's compare the R workflow in [this post](https://data-se.netlify.app/2020/12/05/execution-time-for-largish-data/#typical-data-wrangling) with this [knime workflow](https://github.com/sebastiansauer/sesa-blog/blob/main/static/div/largish-data-wrangling.knwf).



```{r echo = FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sebastiansauer/sesa-blog/main/static/images/knwf-largish1.png")
```


# Comparison

What you think? As an old-fart R user I feel pressed to admit that Knime appears to be a useful and handy tool.
