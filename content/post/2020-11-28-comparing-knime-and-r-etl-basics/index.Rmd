# Knime workflow

Consider this Knime workflow:

# R translation


## Setup

```{r message = FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
library(lubridate)
library(knitr)
```



## Chunk 1: Read, sort, filter


```{r}
datafile <- "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sebastiansauer/sesa-blog/main/static/datasets/sales_2008-2011.csv"

d <- read_csv(datafile)
```

```{r}
glimpse(d)
```

The data is already recognized as date; no need for transformation.


```{r}
d %>% 
  arrange(date) %>% 
  select(-card) -> d
```


## Chunk 2: group and aggregate

```{r}
d %>% 
  group_by(Cust_ID) %>% 
  summarise(amount_sum = sum(amount),
            country = first(country),
            start = min(date),
            end = max(date),
            duration = end - start) -> d_summarized
```


## Chunk 3: filter

```{r}
d_summarized %>% 
  filter(amount_sum > 5000) %>% 
  filter(country == "USA") -> d_summarized_filtered1
```


```{r}
d_summarized %>% 
  filter(between(amount_sum,1000, 2000)) %>% 
  filter(country == "Germany") -> d_summarized_filtered2
```


# Chunk 4: concatenate


```{r}
d_summarized_filtered1 %>% 
  bind_rows(d_summarized_filtered2) -> d_concatenated
```


# Chunk 5: join

Join by ID


```{r}
d_concatenated %>% 
  inner_join(d, by = "Cust_ID") -> d_joined
```


```{r}
kable(d_joined)
```



# Chuunk 6: write to csv


```{r eval = FALSE}
write_csv(d_joined, file = "d_joined.csv")
```
