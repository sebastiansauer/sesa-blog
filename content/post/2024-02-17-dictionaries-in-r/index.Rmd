# Are there Dictionaries in R

There are not built-in dictionaries in R such in a way like they are in Python.
But there's somthing similar. The R-way of working with dictionaries is using *named lists*.



# Named vectors as dictonaries

Let's define a vector with names:

```{r}
cities <- c("France" = "Paris", "Germany" = "Berlin", "UK" = "London")

print(cities)
```



The *names* (France, Germany, UK) work as *keys*  and the values (Paris, Berlin, London) work as the *values.

# Assign keys to a dictionary

If you would like to assign names after having created the vector, no problem:

Here's a vector without names:

```{r}
cities2 <- c("Rome", "Madrid", "Warsaw")
```


Now let's assign names:

```{r}
names2 <- c("Italy", "Spain", "Poland")

names(cities2) <- names2

cities2
```


As can be seen, we have now added values to the keys in the dictionary.

# Adding elements to a dictionary


```{r}
cities["China"] <- "Beijing"

cities
```


# Changing the order of the keys

```{r}
cities2
```

Use indexing to adress the names/keys of the entries in order to change the order:


```{r}
cities2[c("Italy", "Poland", "Spain")]
```



# Combining dictionaries


```{r}
cities3 <- c(cities, cities2)
cities3
```


# Looking up the keys for a given value

Use vector indexing to get the value (e.g., Paris) for a given key (e.g., France):

```{r}
cities["France"]
```

In addition, it is possible to look up multiple values in one go:

```{r}
cities[c("France", "UK")]
```



# Using position index to look-up values


```{r}
cities[1]
```


```{r}
cities[c(1,3)]
```


# Searching for some value

Say we are looking for a value where the first two letters are "Pa":

```{r}
cities[str_detect(cities, "^Pa")]
```


Note that `str_detect` is from `{{stringr}}`, part of `{{tidyverse}}`. 


# Searching for the value given some key fragments

Assume we are searching the for the value of the key (country) starting with "It".

For starters, here are the values (country names):

```{r}
names(cities2)
```

```{r}
cities2[str_detect(names(cities2), "^It")]
```


# Check whether the dictionary contains some key


Do we have the country "UK" in our dictionary?

```{r}
"UK" %in% names(cities3)
```

Yes, we do:

```{r}
cities3
```


# Sort values alphabetically


```{r}
sort(cities)
```


# Sort keys alphabetically

Using the same approach as abover, we now sort the keys (country names):

```{r}
sorted_keys <- sort(names(cities))
sorted_keys
```

And we now sort the values accordingly:

```{r}
cities[sorted_keys]
```


Synonymously:

```{r}
cities[sort(names(cities))]
```
